# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to one of our projects. We deeply appreciate your time
and efforts and always appreciate meaningful improvements.

When contributing to a repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of the repository before making a change. This ensures
that everyone is on-board with the changes you are planning to implement avoiding potential issues
further down the line.

Please note that there is a [Code of Conduct][code_of_conduct], please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of relevant changes if necessary. If present, consider updating the
   wiki page tied to the project including any new features or updating changed parts.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
